# Jameson Whiskey: How I ended up watching a 10 minutes commercial

Today I watched a 10-minutes commercial. Yes, it was on Youtube. In order to watch a 5-minutes video I ended up watching a 10-minutes commercial and even forgot about the video I was supposed to watch in the first place.

Yes, I could have skipped the ad but this was not just a commercial, it was a short. Apparently Jameson Whiskey hired a production company to produce full-length shorts for them (Ha! That sounds funny). These shorts are not necessarily related to the product, which is actually not even mentioned in the video. **It looks like advertising went back in time.**

When my parents were kids, in Italy, television was in black and white and it only had 2 or 3 channels. Those channels were not always active, some of them were blacked out for most of the day, then, at 8:00 pm the whole family would reunite to watch the broadcast.

30 minutes of this broadcast was just advertising, it was called Carosello.

One of the features of the Carosello was that it would contain stories (most of the time stop motions) and at the end of each story the main actors would "bump"  into a product or the product would suddenly come out almost in an unrelated fashion, or just as the brand that "presented" the story.

Today Jameson, brought the Carosello experience on Youtube. In a world where messages are cut shorter and shorter and only talk business (look at vine or twitter) Jameson was able not only to have my attention, but to hold it for a while, up to the point I subscribed to their own channel and now I'm going to watch more of their movies. They are not selling me anything directly, they are just building brand awareness. They take me into a relaxed state of mind and connect their brand to me in that moment. That's pretty powerful. The movies of course represent a world somehow related to their brand values.

I see old people, what that means I don't know, but I do know a good whiskey must be connected to concepts like aged, seasoned and experience that goes through generations.

Why did I watch the whole movie and I did not click on "Skip Ad"? Because the guys that made the short knew how to grab my attention, in the first few seconds I probably thought: "what's going on?" and moments after I was sold. I wanted to watch it. A call to action to subscribe to their channel to get updates on more video? An easy choice after 10 minutes of commitment and relaxed state of mind.

At this moment, after I clicked "Subscribe", the brand Jameson somehow came into my life.

I wonder if that will change anything, next time at the liquor store.
